- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, and any related communication channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces, such as events or social media.

## Enforcement

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
